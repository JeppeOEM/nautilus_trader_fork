Deprecated re-export shim (Story 24.4): `ml_signals.watchlist` moved to the research context
(`research.watchlist`).

Pure re-export, defines nothing: every name here *is* the `research.watchlist` object. Import from
`research.watchlist` instead, e.g. `from research.watchlist import fetch_watchlist`.
