# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-13)

**Core value:** Reliable, continuous capture of Bybit market data into a Nautilus-catalog-compatible parquet archive — no data loss across restarts/disconnects.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — bootstrap-config-end-to-end-slice

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (bootstrap-config-end-to-end-slice) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-06-13 -- Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Persistence: `StreamingConfig` + `StreamingFeatherWriter` + `catalog.convert_stream_to_data()` (no custom CatalogWriter) — decided in research, shapes Phases 1-3
- Single-process / no Redis — one Bybit data client multiplexes LINEAR + SPOT subscriptions
- Official `ParquetDataCatalog` format, partitioned by UTC day

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Open interest has no native Nautilus type/subscription — extraction path (ticker field vs. REST poll) needs a spike to confirm before scoping
- [Phase 2]: Funding-rate ticker pushes ~100ms but changes rarely — dedup strategy needed to avoid millions of redundant rows
- [Phase 1/3]: Catalog `write_data` contract (monotonic ts_init, disjoint intervals, filename-collision silent skip) must hold across restarts — verify the StreamingConfig path handles this
